Ebsteifij on the one hand, considers it possible that the sugar which has passed from the intestinal canal into the vena portae should be excreted by the urine, and, on the other hand, he inclines to the belief that considering the speedy alteration of the sugar, in consequence of a disturbance in the for- mation of carbonic acid, the excretion of sugar through the urine ought to begin with a diabetic patient already half-an-hour after he has partaken of bread.

The muscle, when at rest, stores up glycogen in its tissue in order to change it into sugar when in a state of activity. This sugar in a healthy organism is assimilated totally but in a diseased organism partially. If this process of combustion by muscular action does not take place, and if the liver is no longer able to store up the glycogen which is constantly being conveyed into it, the con- sequence is that, after the consumption of amylaceous substances, that is, of food containing starch, such as bread, potatoes, etc., the blood is surcharged with sugar, and sugar passes into the urine.

According to Kitlz sugar is beginning to be excreted by a diabetic patient within half-an-hour to an hour after he has partaken of bread ; within two or three hours the excretion of sugar reaches its climax, and in five to six hours it ceases. Kiih found that when a patient partakes of bread, sugar is rapidly being formed in the intestinal canal by a ferment which is generated there ; that it speedily reaches the liver, which is unable to retain it, whence it passes into the circulation, so that it is possible for urine free from sugar to become charged with it after the lapse of half-an-hour. According to v. Mering^ the sugar in the ductus thoracicus does not come from the liver, but arises from the saccharine contents of the lymph. This, theory, however, does not exclude the idea that the liver is a storehouse of sugar.
