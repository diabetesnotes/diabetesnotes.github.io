These are notes from today's research session on diabetes mellitus. Some of the statements require corrections and adding references.

According to Kitlz sugar is beginning to be excreted by a diabetic patient within half-an-hour to an hour after he has partaken of bread ; within two or three hours the excretion of sugar reaches its climax, and in five to six hours it ceases. Kiih found that when a patient partakes of bread, sugar is rapidly being formed in the intestinal canal by a ferment which is generated there ; that it speedily reaches the liver, which is unable to retain it, whence it passes into the circulation, so that it is possible for urine free from sugar to become charged with it after the lapse of half-an-hour. According to v. Mering^ the sugar in the ductus thoracicus does not come from the liver, but arises from the saccharine contents of the lymph. This, theory, however, does not exclude the idea that the liver is a storehouse of sugar.

Schedule a yearly physical and regular eye exams. Your regular diabetes checkups aren't meant to replace yearly physicals or routine eye exams. During the physical, your doctor will look for any diabetes-related complications and screen for other medical problems. Your eye care specialist will check for signs of retinal damage, cataracts and glaucoma

Keep your vaccinations up to date. High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. Get a flu shot every year, and your doctor may recommend the pneumonia vaccine, as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also currently recommends hepatitis B vaccination if you haven't previously been vaccinated against hepatitis B and you're an adult ages 19 to 59 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The most recent CDC guidelines advise vaccination as soon as possible after diagnosis with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. If you are age 60 or older, have diabetes, and haven't previously received the vaccine, talk to your doctor about whether it's right for you.

Try using olive oil in cooking rather than clarified butter or ghee. Make use of the blessed Black Seed Oil also, for example, by adding a tablespoon into bread or chappati dough when kneading it.
