According to Kitlz sugar is beginning to be excreted by a diabetic patient within half-an-hour to an hour after he has partaken of bread ; within two or three hours the excretion of sugar reaches its climax, and in five to six hours it ceases. Kiih found that when a patient partakes of bread, sugar is rapidly being formed in the intestinal canal by a ferment which is generated there ; that it speedily reaches the liver, which is unable to retain it, whence it passes into the circulation, so that it is possible for urine free from sugar to become charged with it after the lapse of half-an-hour. According to v. Mering^ the sugar in the ductus thoracicus does not come from the liver, but arises from the saccharine contents of the lymph. This, theory, however, does not exclude the idea that the liver is a storehouse of sugar.

The muscle, when at rest, stores up glycogen in its tissue in order to change it into sugar when in a state of activity. This sugar in a healthy organism is assimilated totally but in a diseased organism partially. If this process of combustion by muscular action does not take place, and if the liver is no longer able to store up the glycogen which is constantly being conveyed into it, the con- sequence is that, after the consumption of amylaceous substances, that is, of food containing starch, such as bread, potatoes, etc., the blood is surcharged with sugar, and sugar passes into the urine.

Keep your vaccinations up to date. High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. Get a flu shot every year, and your doctor may recommend the pneumonia vaccine, as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also currently recommends hepatitis B vaccination if you haven't previously been vaccinated against hepatitis B and you're an adult ages 19 to 59 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The most recent CDC guidelines advise vaccination as soon as possible after diagnosis with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. If you are age 60 or older, have diabetes, and haven't previously received the vaccine, talk to your doctor about whether it's right for you.

Food is needed by the body to provide energy for immediate use by burning up carbohydrates, that is, sugar. Excess of carbohydrates which cannot be used is stored up as fat tissue in muscles, and as glycogen in liver for future use. Insulin, a hormone from the pancreas, lowers blood sugar and diverts it to other forms of energy storage, that is, glycogen.
