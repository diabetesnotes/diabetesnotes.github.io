Schedule a yearly physical and regular eye exams. Your regular diabetes checkups aren't meant to replace yearly physicals or routine eye exams. During the physical, your doctor will look for any diabetes-related complications and screen for other medical problems. Your eye care specialist will check for signs of retinal damage, cataracts and glaucoma

Ebsteifij on the one hand, considers it possible that the sugar which has passed from the intestinal canal into the vena portae should be excreted by the urine, and, on the other hand, he inclines to the belief that considering the speedy alteration of the sugar, in consequence of a disturbance in the for- mation of carbonic acid, the excretion of sugar through the urine ought to begin with a diabetic patient already half-an-hour after he has partaken of bread.

When a diabetic patient was fed with cane-sugar Weiss found 2,369 times more sugar than he did w^hen he was nourished with fibrine and fat, while, on the other hand, the quantity of glycogen in the musculus-pectoralis increased much more by a diet of fibrine (see experiment 3) than it did by a diet of food rich in hydrates of carbon. On the strength of this Zimmer supposes that the muscles, by them- selyes, produce sugar from albuminates in a large quantity, that they secrete it from the albuminates and store it up in the form of glycogen, while the liver is not able to do this. Zimmer maintains that the muscles from albuminates purvey to the blood six times more sugar than the liver ; wherefore he holds that the source of the severer forms of diabetes is to be sought for in the muscles.

Try using olive oil in cooking rather than clarified butter or ghee. Make use of the blessed Black Seed Oil also, for example, by adding a tablespoon into bread or chappati dough when kneading it.

In respect to the origin of the sugar in the blood, as well as in respect to its purpose, consumption, and the use it serves, all inquirers — even those who have proceeded according to the strictly scientific method — have dealt merely in guesses and hypothe- ses. By many who have laboured in this direction it was thus supposed that the oxidation, that is, the consumption, does not take place in the blood, but in the tissues ; consequently, that a priori not the alteration of the substance {Stoffumsatz) but the contents of the living cell are influenced by the oxygen
