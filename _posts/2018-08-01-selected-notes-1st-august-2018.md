In respect to the origin of the sugar in the blood, as well as in respect to its purpose, consumption, and the use it serves, all inquirers — even those who have proceeded according to the strictly scientific method — have dealt merely in guesses and hypothe- ses. By many who have laboured in this direction it was thus supposed that the oxidation, that is, the consumption, does not take place in the blood, but in the tissues ; consequently, that a priori not the alteration of the substance {Stoffumsatz) but the contents of the living cell are influenced by the oxygen

Food is needed by the body to provide energy for immediate use by burning up carbohydrates, that is, sugar. Excess of carbohydrates which cannot be used is stored up as fat tissue in muscles, and as glycogen in liver for future use. Insulin, a hormone from the pancreas, lowers blood sugar and diverts it to other forms of energy storage, that is, glycogen.

The muscle, when at rest, stores up glycogen in its tissue in order to change it into sugar when in a state of activity. This sugar in a healthy organism is assimilated totally but in a diseased organism partially. If this process of combustion by muscular action does not take place, and if the liver is no longer able to store up the glycogen which is constantly being conveyed into it, the con- sequence is that, after the consumption of amylaceous substances, that is, of food containing starch, such as bread, potatoes, etc., the blood is surcharged with sugar, and sugar passes into the urine.

Try using olive oil in cooking rather than clarified butter or ghee. Make use of the blessed Black Seed Oil also, for example, by adding a tablespoon into bread or chappati dough when kneading it.

Keep your vaccinations up to date. High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. Get a flu shot every year, and your doctor may recommend the pneumonia vaccine, as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also currently recommends hepatitis B vaccination if you haven't previously been vaccinated against hepatitis B and you're an adult ages 19 to 59 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The most recent CDC guidelines advise vaccination as soon as possible after diagnosis with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. If you are age 60 or older, have diabetes, and haven't previously received the vaccine, talk to your doctor about whether it's right for you.
