Food is needed by the body to provide energy for immediate use by burning up carbohydrates, that is, sugar. Excess of carbohydrates which cannot be used is stored up as fat tissue in muscles, and as glycogen in liver for future use. Insulin, a hormone from the pancreas, lowers blood sugar and diverts it to other forms of energy storage, that is, glycogen.

In respect to the origin of the sugar in the blood, as well as in respect to its purpose, consumption, and the use it serves, all inquirers — even those who have proceeded according to the strictly scientific method — have dealt merely in guesses and hypothe- ses. By many who have laboured in this direction it was thus supposed that the oxidation, that is, the consumption, does not take place in the blood, but in the tissues ; consequently, that a priori not the alteration of the substance {Stoffumsatz) but the contents of the living cell are influenced by the oxygen

Ebsteifij on the one hand, considers it possible that the sugar which has passed from the intestinal canal into the vena portae should be excreted by the urine, and, on the other hand, he inclines to the belief that considering the speedy alteration of the sugar, in consequence of a disturbance in the for- mation of carbonic acid, the excretion of sugar through the urine ought to begin with a diabetic patient already half-an-hour after he has partaken of bread.

Try using olive oil in cooking rather than clarified butter or ghee. Make use of the blessed Black Seed Oil also, for example, by adding a tablespoon into bread or chappati dough when kneading it.
